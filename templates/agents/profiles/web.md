## Web App Profile

This is a FastAPI + React TypeScript monorepo.

* Backend: `backend/`
* Frontend: `frontend/`
* Root scripts coordinate both sides.

## Commands

```powershell
.\scripts\check.ps1
.\scripts\fix.ps1
```

Backend commands run from `backend/` with `uv`. Frontend commands run from `frontend/` with `npm.cmd` on Windows when available.

Keep API behavior in the backend and browser behavior in the frontend. Do not make backend tests depend on the frontend dev server, and do not commit generated build output.
