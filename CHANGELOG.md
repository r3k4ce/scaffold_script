## [v0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- `new-project.ps1` scaffolder that turns an empty folder into a checked,
  agent-ready project (README.md:1-9, new-project.ps1:1-15).
- Four profiles, selected with `-Profile`:
  - `base` — uv-managed Python package with `src/` layout, tests, checks, CI.
  - `desktop` — `base` plus a PySide6 starter window under `src/<package>/ui/`.
  - `web` — FastAPI backend with a Vite + React + TypeScript frontend.
  - `game` — FastAPI backend with a Vite + TypeScript + Phaser frontend and a
    Playwright smoke test.
  (new-project.ps1:9, README.md:36-40)
- Generated tooling for every profile:
  - `uv` for Python packaging and dependency management.
  - Ruff for linting and formatting.
  - Pyright for static type checking (mode configurable via `-TypeMode`).
  - pytest with coverage (branch coverage, 80% fail-under).
  (new-project.ps1:931-940, README.md:46-49)
- PowerShell helper scripts: `scripts/check.ps1` and `scripts/fix.ps1` to run
  the full check/fix pipeline (new-project.ps1:1171-1214, README.md:50).
- GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` covering Ruff format,
  Ruff lint, Pyright, pytest, and (for `web` / `game`) frontend lint, build,
  unit tests, and Playwright e2e (new-project.ps1:820-898, 1269-1308).
- Pre-commit and pre-push hooks via `pre-commit` (new-project.ps1:1136-1167,
  README.md:52).
- `AGENTS.md` generated from a base template plus a profile-specific snippet
  (new-project.ps1:134-141, README.md:53).
- Project memory file at `docs/project-memory.yaml`, written as a YAML log
  entry with timestamp, summary, changed list, and verification step
  (new-project.ps1:1252-1265, README.md:54).
- Standard repo hygiene files: `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`,
  `.env.example` (new-project.ps1:1043-1134, 586-674 for web/game).
- Flags to opt out of side effects: `-NoGit`, `-NoInstallHooks`,
  `-NoGitHubActions` (new-project.ps1:12-14, README.md:142-144).
